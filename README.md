# Masked

## UX

The design of the site is bootstrap influenced in the use of the navbar, and other components of bootstrap such as 
cards, and jumbotrons. The site itself is kept to be simple with a beige background colour on the index.html (landing) page,
and a single image rendered. Within this initial page, any user who comes across the site will be able to figure out the
purpose/reason the site exists - to sell face masks.

The landing page was designed with this template in mind. In terms of usage of colour, and the simple image + text
combined to create a simple landing page which explains the purpose of the site whilst not overpopulating the user 
with content / information when first visitng (or re-visitng) the site.

The navbar was made to have a white background so it remains visible on all pages despite the content / colours that 
may be shown.
