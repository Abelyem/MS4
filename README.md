# Masked

## UX

The design of the site is bootstrap influenced in the use of the navbar, and other components of bootstrap such as 
cards, and jumbotrons. The site itself is kept to be simple with a beige background colour on the index.html (landing) page,
and a single image rendered. Within this initial page, any user who comes across the site will be able to figure out the
purpose/reason the site exists - to sell face masks.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to use the site on any device
- As a user, I want to be able to filter through all face masks available on the site
- As a user, I want to be able to see all face masks set by price (low-high/high-low)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to filter the face masks by dark and light shades
- As a user, I want to be able to search for specific face masks that suit my needs
- As a user, I want to be able to add individual items to my bag and continue shopping
- As a user, I want to be able to remove any items from my bag before proceeding to checkout
- As a user, I want any items added to my bag to remain there unless removed by myself 
- As a user, I want to be able to register and log into my individual account
- As a user, I want the option to save my details when purchasing items 
- As a user, I want to be able to see a history of all my previous purchases



## Wireframes

[Landing page - ](https://github.com/Abelyem/MS4/blob/master/static/wireframes/img/landing_page_wireframe.png)

The landing page was designed with this template in mind. In terms of usage of colour, and the simple image + text
combined to create a simple landing page which explains the purpose of the site whilst not overpopulating the user 
with content / information when first visitng (or re-visitng) the site.

The navbar was made to have a white background so it remains visible on all pages despite the content / colours that 
may be shown, take a different approach than the wireframe as I wanted the search feature to be clearly visible at all
times, and not hidden behind an image / other components.
